    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      At <strong>Image-Cut</strong>, we believe that speed, precision, and visual quality are the foundation of every exceptional online experience.
      Whether you manage a digital store, a creative blog, or a high-traffic portfolio, your images define how fast your site loads,
      how professional it looks, and how search engines rank it. Our mission is to make advanced image optimization accessible, reliable,
      and effortless — without sacrificing quality.
    </p>

    <h2>The Technology Behind Image-Cut</h2>
    <p>
      Image-Cut is built for creators who value both clarity and performance. Each uploaded file is analyzed and optimized using
      cutting-edge algorithms that understand the difference between <strong>lossy</strong> and <strong>lossless compression</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Lossy compression</em> reduces file size by removing subtle visual data that the human eye rarely perceives. It’s perfect for
      <strong>web-ready images</strong> where page speed and bandwidth are critical — formats such as <strong>JPEG</strong> or
      <strong>WEBP (lossy)</strong> can cut image weight dramatically while preserving beautiful detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Lossless compression</em>, on the other hand, keeps every pixel of the original intact. It’s essential for logos, UI elements,
      or high-precision graphics. Formats such as <strong>PNG</strong> and <strong>WEBP (lossless)</strong> maintain perfect visual fidelity
      with smaller file sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our system intelligently chooses the ideal compression type based on image transparency, complexity, and purpose — ensuring that
      your visuals remain stunning while your website loads in an instant.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Image Optimization Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Optimizing images isn’t only about saving space — it’s about creating a faster, smarter web.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SEO Benefits:</strong> Google rewards sites that load quickly. Compressed images improve <em>Core Web Vitals</em>, boosting your ranking potential.</li>
      <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Visitors expect a site to load within two seconds. Lightweight images keep them engaged and reduce bounce rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Bandwidth Efficiency:</strong> Smaller files save hosting costs and improve performance across all devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That’s why <strong>Image-Cut</strong> is more than a tool — it’s an essential step in your site’s optimization workflow.
    </p>
